<h1>About My Painting</h1>
<p>
Broadly, most of my

  I take a different approach as my mother, Lisa, and her quilting practice are the focus of the painting. After translating a photograph taken by my sister of her over a thousand miles away at my newly turned childhood home to a rough drawing, I used hundreds of layers of acrylic paint to establish her matriarchal pose. To add finishing patterns and details to the quilt fabric, I utilized multiple paint and permanent markers. It was crucial to cleanly render the small threads that bind the quilt, just as my mom is the thread that binds our family. Recently, especially after moving from home, I've been thinking about family and bonds very often, which is also the purpose behind her quilting. My mother has created a quilt for nearly each member and branch of my family, yet she rarely refers to herself as the artist she rightfully is.Therefore, this painting focuses not only on her role as a mother and my relationship with her, but also her talent and craftsmanship that often comes secondary when combined with the title of mother.
